# Megijima Webapp

The project engages the small island community of Megijima, Japan, exploring the [HUMAN:NATURE] connection through direct interaction with the community and ecological environment using image, word, and sound.

The resulting data – both factual and sensory – will be woven into an interactive web application experience, exploring how a peoples' connection to nature informs and directs the ecological, cultural, and economic development of the communities in which they live.
