As the police chief of Megijima and acting one-man police force, my most important duty is the regulation of wild boars (inoshishi) on the island. Originally from Ogijima, the boars had limited space to thrive and swam approximately one-and-a-half kilometers to find a new home on Megijima. In addition to ravaging Megijimaâ€™s crops, the boar can also be dangerous to the inhabitants of the island. According to Japanese law, a person requires a license to hunt and shoot the inoshishi. Farmers on the island, therefore resort to scaring them off using the loud explosions of celebratory fireworks.
