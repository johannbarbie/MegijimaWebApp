For me, the most scenic place of Megijima Island is the top of the mountain where the cave is located. There you can enjoy the panoramic view of the island, the sea, and the main land of Japan. In a sunny day, you can also see Great Seto Bridge. The beauty of Megijima is unparalleled by any other islands in Japan. Of my many cherished memories of the island are the times I have spent with my grandchildren. The time I spend with them is especially precious since, as a father, I could not afford the time with my own children that I have with my grandchildren.
