My husband is a fisherman who often has to leave the safety of the island to go far out to see in order to secure a good catch. There are many powerful memories that my husband and I share from the years that we have lived together on Megijima. One particular place that is especially significant to our lives here is the port. There were many occasions when my husband was out at sea during dangerous storms that turned the normally tranquil ocean into a violent tempest with roaring waves and screaming winds. I would become anxious for his safety and, with our children, would stand at the port and pray into the night for my husband\'s safe return. The sight of his boat inching back to us would fill our hearts with joy and thanks.<br>In addition to fishing, we also grow crops of corn, garlic, peanuts and other vegetables. Since we do not farm for commercial reasons, we have the freedom to grow what we like. We work with nature and often plant what is in season. The important thing is that our grandchildren enjoy the crops that we grow.
