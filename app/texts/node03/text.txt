Mrs. Hashimoto, whose husband was a fisherman, says that her memorial place is the port of the island. When it was windy and the waves were high, she was anxious for her husband and went to see the port with her small child even in the middle of the night. Mr. Takahashi says that the most scenic place of Megi-jima Island is the top of the mountain, where the cave is located. There you can enjoy the panoramic view. In a sunny day, you can also see Great Seto Bridge.
