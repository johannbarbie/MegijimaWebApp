As a fisherman who often has to leave the safety of the island to go far out to see in order to secure a good catch, there are many powerful memories that my wife and I share from the years that we have lived together on Megijima. One particular place that is especially significant to our lives here is the port. There were many occasions when I was out at sea during dangerous storms that turned the normally tranquil ocean into a violent tempest with roaring waves and screaming winds. I would become fearful that I would not return safely to my wife and children, but I always managed to return to a port where my wife and children would be waiting.  The sight of their faces would fill my heart with joy.
In addition to fishing, we also grow crops of corn, garlic, peanuts and other vegetables. Since we do not farm for commercial reasons, we have the freedom to grow what we like. We work with nature and often plant what is in season. The important thing is that our grandchildren enjoy the crops that we grow.
