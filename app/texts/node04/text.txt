About 40 years ago, my wife moved from Ogi-jima Island to Megi-jima Island to to become my bride. She was featured in the local magazine as an example of “Seto no hanayome (Bride of Seto).” “Seto no hanayome” is also the name of a Japanese pop song that was famous in the 1970’s. The phrase, like the song, tells a story of bride who gets married to a man from a different island. In the past, it was common that people find their partners from other islands because the inhabitants of each island were all related. Since our marriage, my wife and I have been farming rice, eggplants, tomatoes, corn, apricots, and other fruits and vegetables for our family. In the past, we also sold our vegetables to the JA, but we mostly grew for our own consumption.
