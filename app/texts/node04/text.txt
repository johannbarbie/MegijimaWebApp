"It is not about money, it is about affection" says Mr. Nakamura. He shares the newly harvested rice with his relatives. He thinks that eating rice from the same rice field makes the family bounds stronger.  Mr. Nakamura often took his grandchildren to his rice field. He also has had lunch together with his family at the rice field before. In the past, it was common that people find their partner from another island in Setouchi. About 40 years ago Mrs. Nakamura moved from Ogi-jima Island to Megi-jima Island to get married with Mr. Nakamura. She was featured in the local magazine as an example of “Seto no hanayome (Bride of Seto).” “Seto no hanayome” is also the name of the Japanese famous pop song of 70’s. The song tells a story of newly bride who gets married to a man of a different island of Setouchi.
