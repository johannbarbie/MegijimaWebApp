It is not about money; it is about affection, and this affection can be expressed through the food that we grow and share. A family that eats rice from the same field creates a strong bond. I often take my grandchildren to my rice field and have lunch with them to share this idea. Our rice field is a very significant place for my family. It is a place to relax and connect.
