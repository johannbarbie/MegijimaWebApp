The main crops of Megijima are tobacco, wheat, peanut, potato, and sweet potato. When it's wheat season, the whole island becomes yellow because of the wheat flower. A long time ago, all the households had two cows, so more than 300 cows inhabited the island. Since 1961 the number of milk producing cows decreased. Megijima had an elementary school, junior high school, and a big sport festival which lasted from the morning and went on until the late night. There was also a three-day dance festival. At that time the population of the island was more than 1300. Today the population is approximately 140 and we only have one main event on the island which is Bon Odori.
