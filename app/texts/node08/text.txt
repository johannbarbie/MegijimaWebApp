When I was a young boy, my friend visited me from Takamatsu and we camped on the beach, playing, fishing, and creating great memories that I cherish to this day. Now when my grandchildren visit, they enjoy the camping and fishing just as I did when I was their age. Watching them while reliving my own memories brings me much joy.
When the Seto bridge opened, many tourist came to visit Megijima. At that time, my wife was working in the Oni's cave and was extremely busy.  The visitors experienced the same joys that were experienced by the citizens of Megijima such as the bountiful cherry blossom trees. Those were planted by elementary students when they graduated.
