Mrs. Nakakouji says that growing potatoes in the island is not a good idea anymore because wild boars eat most of them. Originally there lived no wild boar in Megi-jima Island. It is said that some wild boars swam from Ogi-jima Island to Megi-jima Island and they bred and multiplied. Potatoes grown in her field were also eatn by wild boars. Therefore she has started to grow potatoes in her garden. She worries that if wild boars start to come around her house, she cannot grow any potatoes. There used to be a graveyard near from the beach. However, as the number of tourists has increased, the graveyard has been moved uphill. The original graveyard has been changed into a park.
