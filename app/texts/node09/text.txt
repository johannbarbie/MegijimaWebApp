Growing potatoes on the island is not a good idea anymore because wild boars eat most of them. Originally there were no wild boars in Megijima, but that all changed when a few swam from Ogijima to Megijima and they bred and multiplied. Despite my experience with the boars, I do have a small patch of soil where I grow a few potatoes, but I mostly grow okra, rice, tobacco, and garlic. Of my favorite places on the island is the old beach that is now being developed. My memories of this place included singing songs with friends, catching dragon flies, and relaxing near the cave.
