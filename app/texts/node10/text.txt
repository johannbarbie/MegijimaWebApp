 When I was in 8th grade, I enjoyed playing volleyball and other sports. When I got a little older, I began to coach volleyball as well as play. I did this until I began working Even now, at 79 years-old, I still play volleyball. I am one of the oldest players in Takamatsu-shi city. 
In my twenties, I worked as a cave guide. I have also been involved in farming, growing corn, garlic, and peas. Garlic is the easiest to grow and yields more profit than other vegetables. When I turn 80 years-old I plan to retire from farming.
