I used to go to the west coast and the seashore below the light house in order to gather clams. I would often go home with many bag-fulls of clams, but as the years have passed, the number of the clams has been steadily decreasing. I love wild jonquil flowers which grow all around the island. Every year I pick dozens of them and sell them in Takamatsu city for pocket money. I also ships some of them to the market to be sold.
