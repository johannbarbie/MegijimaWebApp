Mrs. Kurokawa used to go to the west coast and the seashore below the light house in order to catch different clams. Before she was able to find many clams, but recently the number of the clams has been decreasing. She loves wild jonquil flowers which grow all around the island. Every year she picks up a lot of jonquil flowers. She also ships some of them to the market.
