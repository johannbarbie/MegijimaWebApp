I have an eighty-three-year-old relative, who grows mandarins at the other side of the island. Every year I help her pick up the mandarins, but I mostly fish for a living catching Spanish mackerel, abalone, and sea cucumber. My wife and children live in Takamatsu because my children go to school there. When I am off, I take the ferry go visit them. Transportation is more convenient today than it was just a few years ago, but there still needs to be improvements. More people would come back to the island if the last ship would leave around 8:00 pm from the Takamatsu port. People would have the opportunity to come back to the island after they finish their job in Takamatsu.
