Before my wife became a farmer, I was half fisherman and half farmer. I often went out to sea fishing for three months at a time. I also went to Osaka by myself to work.
In the winter, my wife and I grew wheat. In the Summer it was sweet potato. We used cows to plow the field and we could rent a cow from Takamatsu in exchange for rice.
When people from Osaka started to build the Summer house, we created the garlic association and began to focus on growing garlic. The main crops in Megijima are wheat, rice, and plum. Plum was very popular for some time. At that time, It was typical for women in Megijima to seek employment in Osaka after graduating junior high school. They would typically work for 3-5 years and then return to Megijima.
There was a time when I raised silk worms on my farm. This was the most lucrative form of farming that I have ever done.
