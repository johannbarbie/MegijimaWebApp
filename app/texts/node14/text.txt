I have been living on Megijima island since 1953, and for the majority of that time I have been a fisherman, catching fish, octopus, and shrimp. The fish caught around Megijima were gathered and shipped to Takamatsu for commercial sale. About 40 years ago, I was involved in a ship accident that almost took my life. It was a normal day, and I was going about my usual business fishing when a ship that was about 20 times the size of my vessel came headed straight for me. I had no time to maneuver my boat out of its path, and had to jump out of my boat into the water to save my own life. It was a very scary moment for me.
