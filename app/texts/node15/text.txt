The star speckled sky of Megijima is one of the most beautiful aspects of the island. On one side of the sky is the glow of lights of Takamatsu which slowly fade into the pitch black sky of an undisturbed island, sprinkled with bright flecks of light, making it appear as if hand fulls of diamonds were thrown into a moon light lake. From the observation deck on the top of the mountain I can enjoy this spectacular view as well as the view of Setouchi, the ocean, islands, and the slow ferries moving from port to port. Visitors to the island who experienced these views were in awe, describing the vistas as amazing. If I use a bicycle to go to the observation deck, is very difficult, but worth the work. The way back is much easier and enjoyable.
