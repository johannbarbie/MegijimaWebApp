Many people ask me my secret to a long and healthy life, and I explain that it is very simple. Every day I make sure to eat meat and enjoy a drink. In the summer, my drink of choice is beer, and in the winter it is sake. I also avoid planting vegetables because I hate vegetables. In my garden I mainly grow peas, beans, and peanuts. I was born on Megijima, but when I was a young girl, I moved to Osaka for about three years working in a cosmetic shop. I returned to Megijima after the war and found that many things had changed. Before the war, there were many beachfront restaurants, but they are all gone now. When they graduated from elementary school, many people were working at those restaurants . And I was working for tourism association as a tour guide for the Oni cave.
