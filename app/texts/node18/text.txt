We love to spend time in the Sumiyoshi temple and temple road. We also love spending time at the beach at night and taking in the view of Takamatsu port from Megijima. Compared to other islands, Megijima is a very calm and peaceful place. The purpose of most of young people who come to Megijima is either to attend to art festival or to take photos of the island, but we decided to come here to live a more grounded existence and to open our own restaurant. So far, we are happy with our decision, and are enjoying the island life.
