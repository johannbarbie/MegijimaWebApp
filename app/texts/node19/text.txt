I am originally from Takamatsu; however, I feel attached to Megijima as if it were my birth home. From the fertile soil and thriving vegetation, to the warm and hospitable inhabitants, I love everything about Megijima. Of my many fond memories of the island, is my first trip to Oniâ€™s cave. I was just a child, but I can still remember the feeling of the cool temperature on my skin. There is a certain power in Megijima, which is why I am so passionate about working here and helping Megima to be the best it can be.
