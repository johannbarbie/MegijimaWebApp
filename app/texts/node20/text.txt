Springtime in Megijima is accented by the abundance of cherry blossoms. The beauty and ambiance created by this time of year make every day sublime experience. The view of the sunset from the vantage point of the lighthouse looks as if the sky is a blue canvas painted with a blend or pink and orange hues that turn Megijima into a scene worthy to be captured by a master artist. Since I am a fisherman by trade and work every day in the ocean to make a living, the ocean does not provide me with any special emotions. Fishing to me is analogous to breathing. It is just what I do, so I do not really think about it.
