I have four siblings and we are all very close. I have more chances to spend time with them than with my friends. When we have any problem I always talk with them and they help me any way that they can. This is the importance of family.
I recommend the Goya as the favorite food from this island. A few years ago, I started to grow the Goya for personal consumption. At this time, others on the island began growing it as well. Since my health is not what it once was, I am careful to not work too much, but I enjoy the time I spend in the garden and it does not feel like work.
