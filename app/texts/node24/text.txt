We have been enjoying the farmer life for many years. We have one small farm in the front of our home and another up in the hill. It is a peaceful place with a wonderful view of the ocean, Yashima, Takamatsu, and other nearby places. Usually we are able to farm from year to year without any problems; however, there was one year we had to close one of our farms due to the inoshishi.
