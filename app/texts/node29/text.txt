Megijima is said to be the "Island of the cherry tree." In the spring time, with the perfume of the blossoming cherry blossoms wafting through the breeze and the vibrant pink petals carpeting the narrow roads, Megijima is a very beautiful place indeed. The view of Takamatsu City from Megijima creates a dynamic contrast between a modern Japanese city and the serenity of a traditional country scape. This juxtaposition amplifies the beauty and power of both environments, adding to Megijimaâ€™s splendor.
