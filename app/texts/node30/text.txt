When I was 18 years-old, I left Megijima for Nagano and Osaka. I lived in Osaka around 10 years and came back to Megijima 17 or 18 years ago. A very special thing about Megijima is the night view of Takamatsu. In addition, the Seto bridge, the sunsets, and the stars at night are very beautiful. Because of the lack of city lights, Megijima gets very dark, making the stars shimmer against a pitch black backdrop.
